    <h1>Engineer? Developer? Fraud?</h1>
    <p>
        I started this website to force myself into the uncomfortable unknown. I've always wanted to do personal projects, solve problems, do something that I felt was meaningful, but two things always prevented me from starting.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>What the heck do I even pursue? I've never had an aha moment as to what to work on.</li>
        <li>Fear of scrutiny. The idea of having my code, my ideas, past and present under public scrutiny has always been a deterrent to my beginning a journey of self discovery through coding and software.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Now I'm trying to take the first step into something, anything, by at least getting my personal site up, and an initial "blog" (if you can even call it that) up. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So what am I doing here? Hopefully I will find out somewhere on this journey, for now this is, a start.
    </p>
    <p>
        Professionally I am a Software Developer for a fairly large organization, writing, maintaining, designing Web application with a variety of technologies, mostly backend focused.
    </p>
    <p>
        Personally I enjoy spending time with my Wife, rock climbing and the occasional game of chess; but there is always this small part of my brain that wants to pursue something in software but it is always suppressed by the question. "but what?" 
        A blog? pfft, no, I can't write. right?
        A framework? pfft, no, reddit has already decided everything has been done by better smarter people. why reinvent the wheel... idiot.
        A project? maybe.. but what project, and the cycle continues.
    </p>
    <p>
        So "creating" this website is the start of something, and with any luck, not also the end of it. Log 0 in the books.
